    <h1>My Website</h1>
     <p>Hey there, I'm Felix.</p>
     <p>Welcome to my own website. You will learn about me and my projects here. By the way: This website is 100% self-encoded, without any external help</p>
    
    <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>I live in Saarland, Germany.<br>Some of my hobbies are:</p>

     <br>
     <p>Furthermore, I am interested in Snooker and sailing.</p>
     <p>Additionally, I am an »aviation geek«. I think, I know more about planes than anyone else at my school!</p>
     <br>
     <p>For all those who are a bit into coding, some of my programming skills are:</p>

    <h3>My projects</h3> 
   
     <p>I am the owner of an e-sports team called »WFC eSports«. You might never have heard of it, as it is formed of me and a few of my frieds only and it is more a fun thing than a professional e-sports team... However, we have a homepage, and I'm in the role of its head developer.</p>
     <p>Another project of mine is a game that will be playable on a platform called »Roblox« one day. Actually, Roblox is full of games for 5-year old kids, but programming with its engine is similar to do so with other game engines like »Unity« or »Unreal Engine«.</p>
